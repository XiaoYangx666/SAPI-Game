/**
 * Standalone build for `@begame/observatory`.
 *
 * The package used to be built only by the monorepo's root `rolldown.config.ts`,
 * which addressed every workspace by a repo-relative path (`packages/...`). That
 * made the Observatory impossible to build or run outside the BEGame checkout,
 * so the build lives here and is self-contained: it resolves everything from
 * this package's own directory.
 *
 * Two bundles are produced:
 *
 * - `dist/`    — the Node server, with `@begame/trace` and the Node/npm
 *                dependencies kept external so they resolve from `node_modules`.
 * - `public/build/` — the browser workbench UI, fully bundled.
